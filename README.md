# 🌾 AI Agent for Smart Farming Advice

An intelligent AI-powered assistant built using **IBM Cloud Lite**, **Watsonx**, and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** that supports **small-scale farmers** by offering real-time, localized agricultural insights. The agent can provide updates on weather forecasts, crop suggestions, mandi prices, pest alerts, and more — all in local languages.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Small and marginal farmers often lack access to timely, accurate agricultural information. This leads to poor crop decisions, lower yields, and reduced income. Existing advisory systems are often generic, difficult to access, or not localized.

### 🔍 Our Solution:
An AI Agent that:
- Answers questions like:
  - “What crop is best to grow now?”
  - “What is today’s mandi rate for onions?”
  - “How do I control whiteflies in cotton?”
